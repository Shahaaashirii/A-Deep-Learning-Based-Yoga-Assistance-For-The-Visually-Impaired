Yoga offers many physical, mental, and emotional benefits, and having a trained instructor
by our side can significantly enhance the experience and outcomes. Individuals often turn
to social media and online tutorials as accessible resources for their yoga training needs
as itâ€™s not easy to have a personal yoga trainer for lots of issues. Here we have proposed
a system that makes yoga more accessible and inclusive to individuals, especially the
visually impaired. The system provides them voice-based guidance to estimate and
correct yoga poses in real time. This enables users to interact with the system via voice
commands. The voice assistant utilizes text-to-speech and speech-to-text mechanisms for
communication. Users can verbally request specific routines, receive real-time feedback,
and customize their yoga experience. The system is trained to predict and correct yoga
poses based on body key points using a deep learning Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN)
